# Email-spam-classification


Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object.

Random forest classifier does a great job in classifying spam emails.
The model is trained on the training set that contains spam and ham emails (labelled). The model learns from the training set and classifies the spam emails in the test set.
